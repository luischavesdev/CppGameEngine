# CppGameEngine
 Engine made with C++ based on OpenGL and Box2D. The engine comes with a Game project to exemplify its workings, so be sure to compile the engine first before compiling the game. 

 It should work out of the box with Visual Studio, just be sure to set the Game as the startup project. Necessary dlls are already on the output debug folder.
